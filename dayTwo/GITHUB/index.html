            <li>With out verify the email its not possible to create repositories in github.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Create your first Github repository</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>There are two ways to create repositories in github.
                <ul>
                    <li>Directly on the web portal by cloning other repositories.</li>
                    <li>Develop project on your development machine and sync it with your github account</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Again to create local repository we need two softtwares need to be installed in the dev machine.
                <ul>
                    <li>Github downloader</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After successfully installing github we need to login to the app with the credentials of github account.</li>
            <li>Git is a bash command line interface specially for Github.</li>
            <li>"git init" is the simple command to initialize the repository.</li>
            <li>Git is responsible for tracking the changes in your surce code.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Commit the repository to Github</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The way to upload the source code to ithub is via "commit".</li>
            <li>Every time when the changes are made in the source code new commits need to be done to keep the two way synchronising</li>
            <li>In case of multiple authors for the repository, It is very important to pull the latest changes (if there are any) before start developing. </li>
            <li>The reason is if you develop your code without pulling the latest changes from the sourse code,
                by the time you want to commit to sourse code,  Github will not
            allow to commit before you pull the latest changes.You have to remove all the changes you have made and sync the code then after start the development. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to delete a repository in github.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the home page of the repository which need to be deleted.</li>
            <li>On the top nav you will find settings, go there and scroll down. There will be an option "delete this repository". </li>
            <li>Once deleted its gone it's gone, there is no revert back.</li>
        </ol>
